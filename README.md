Creating a web - based app that can operate on multiple platforms and devices.

The client, The Gaming Room, wants to enhance their current app to a web - based app that works on multiple platforms and devices.

The part that I did well was explaining the different OPs and their functions. In doing so, being able to give an educated recommendation based on the facts.

The process this document took me on was very benificial for my longterm goal due to the step by step process. It allowed me to have a first hand experience in what it takes to develop software, as well as breaking it down for the client to understand.

Honestly, there is nothing I would change or enhance. Over the course, I added and taken away from this document. I made my errors and corrected them, as well as made changes based on feedback. 

It's imperative to consider the needs of the user because it could be a reason why the code has to be reconstructed. It's good practice to always code with the functions of the app in mind. This would allow the designer to create a well thought out app. This is what I did while completing the assignment.

My approach was subtle and simple... I went over the summory of the clients expectations and then their requirments for the app. Then I broke it down into sections to complete indivdualy. This is something I would continue to do in the future due to the importance in scripting a long code in sections.
